## Step 3: Test SSH Connection via the Terminal

1. In the VSC terminal, type the following command to test an SSH connection to a test IP:

   ```bash
   ssh user@ip-address
   ```

   Replace `user` with the username and `ip-address` with the IP of the server youâ€™re testing.

2. If prompted, confirm the server's fingerprint by typing `yes`.

3. Enter the password when prompted.

4. If successful, you will see a welcome message from the server.

   To exit the SSH session, type:

   ```bash
   exit
   ```

## Step 4: Connect to a Remote Server via VSC SSH Extension

1. Open Visual Studio Code and go to the **Extensions** view by clicking the square icon on the left or pressing `Ctrl + Shift + X`.

 open the **Command Palette** by pressing: `Ctrl + Shift + P` 
 and type `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host` and select it.

6. Enter your SSH connection string in the format:

   ```bash
   user@remote-server-ip
   ```

   Replace `user` with your username and `remote-server-ip` with the server's IP address.

7. If this is your first time connecting, confirm the server's fingerprint by typing `yes`.

8. Enter the password when prompted.

9. Once connected, VSC will reopen in a remote context.
